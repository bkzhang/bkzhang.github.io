Good things to know to be guaranteed jobs in the software industry is C, C++ and Linux. I have always said and will always continue saying it. The complexity and power behind C++ programs are far beyond those of other languages. Extensive usage in it will reinforce good coding practices and enable a strong understanding of memory allocation and bitwise shifting. Working in higher level languages such as Python, Ruby or JavaScript will lower your knowledge of core performance engineering concepts through a higher level of abstraction.

Before starting your interviews, knowledge of Big O Notation is a given since it is so heavily reinforced by recruiters and others who've been interviewed. However, it is also very important to have practical experience with bitwise shift operations and memory allocation in lower level languages. Those types of questions can surprisingly come up quite often during various screening processes and typically many students do not extensively learn nor find the need to understand how to apply them due to their minimal appearances in smaller side projects.

Another important requirement is working in a GNU environment. There may often be questions relating to its various terminal commands such as greping a web address. The best way to practice and develop a deep understanding of how Linux works is by using a minimal Linux distro and building your system from the ground up. You do not necessarily need a super high maintenance distro but if possible, tend to go as down low as possible. Good distros include ArchLinux, Gentoo and Funtoo.

For me personally, I will have to dig deeper and completely rebuild my understanding of object orientated programming from the ground up starting with C then moving onto C++ before I finally settle on Python for data science. I hope I am able to learn fast to keep in pace with the continuously high expectations of the job industry.

Toodlehoo till next time.
