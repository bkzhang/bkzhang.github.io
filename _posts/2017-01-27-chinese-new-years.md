Happy Chinese New Years! Not much here to be said, just wishing everyone the best for the next lunar cycle. Hopefully you can all pursue what you love best and pump out new and cool and innovating ideas. Good luck!

Here's a cool and relavent curl.
<br>

``` bash
curl wttr.in/moon
```

<br>

Also works for weather.
<br>

``` bash
curl wttr.in/Ottawa
curl -s wttr.in/Ottawa | head -7
```
