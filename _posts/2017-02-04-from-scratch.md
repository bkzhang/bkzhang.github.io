Got my laptop a month ago and I already have 100 gb in systems memory.... Too many junk files, dotfile colorschemes and the like. I need a better package manager, maybe I should move to nix. Anyways, doing a complete os reinstall this weekend and hope to dual boot ArchLinux alongside my macOS. Going to reset my config too, having learned a lot of DOs and DON'Ts from my previous experience, hopefully can minimize junk dependencies and optimize workflow performance and speed.
