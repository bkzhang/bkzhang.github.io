A hobbit should feel comfortable sitting on his rocking chair by the warm hearth reading about my miserable life. Unfortunately you probably aren't a hobbit, nor by a warm hearth, but my life is definitely miserable.

Poor [Branch Bunch](https://github.com/Branch-Bunch), so much code to write but even more school to attend. Just reading the assignment  and pre-lab document is a struggle. Dozens of pages to read, and a ton of work to do, all due on Friday. To attend hackathons or to straight up fail university..tough choices.
