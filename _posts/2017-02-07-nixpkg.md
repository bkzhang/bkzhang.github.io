So I did a clean macOS install and also VMed ArchLinux onto my desktop this weekend.

Seeing as how Homebrew can create a large unmanageable mess as time goes on, I decided to move to Nixpkgs. I admit I sometimes miss the ease and simplicity of Homebrew, however after moving to Nix, my laptop never felt so clean. I also gained a newfound respect for spotlight. Trying to configure kwm and khd was originally such a pain since I had no idea what launchctl did and relied solely on brew services. So, this process has actually widen my vision and broadened my mind quite a bit, every time you try something new its an awesome learning process. Tinker tinker tinker tinker, we aren't geniuses, we just play with it till it works or breaks.
