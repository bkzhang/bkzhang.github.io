I'm an aspiring data scientist currently in my second year of uni. I like to rice and code. My biggest passion besides coding is reading and writing and studying the lore of all things. High, dark fantasy, cyberpunk, horror, sci-fi, come shower me with your masterfully written literature and syntastically beauitfully written code.

Since I am spending most of my time on my macbook, my current rice is something simple and on macos. The screen is too small for the best rices.

Before the rising of the sun Eärendil slew Ancalagon the Black, the mightiest of the dragon-host, and cast him from the sky; and he fell upon the towers of Thangorodrim, and they were broken in his ruin.
